I am a young student currently studying in the IB program. Some hobbies of mine are cooking, playing sports such as snowboarding, swimming, volleyball, basketball, soccer, table tennis etc. I am also an owner of multiple pets and I consider my home a zoo. I am also a traveller and I enjoy journying. I have visited some of the world's most beautiful places it has to offer. Countries like Italy, Japan, France, USA, Canada, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and more!

My mission in life: To live life embracing the feeling of achievement and success, while balancing a healthy physical and mental fortitude through working hard and constantly obtaining my goals. This journey cultivates experience, resilience, growth and bravery which allows me to further pave my path in life with purpose and tranquility.

As my favourite saying goes: "The time is always right, to do what is right." - MLK Jr.

Now here are some images that I believe greatly represent me:
